rs-sdk is a typescript library for driving bots inside a recognizable economic role-playing mmo. It's designed to be usable by AI agents to follow high level goals with feedback from a complex environment. 

You can automate the game, level an account to all 99s, experiment with agent techniques like "ralph loops", and explore agent-agent collaboration and economics in a controlled, research-oriented setting.

There is currently a [leaderboard](https://rs-sdk-demo.fly.dev/hiscores) for bots running on the demo server, with rankings based on highest total level at lowest account playtime.


## Getting Started :
This repo is designed to be cloned and developed inside of.

## Gameplay Modifications

This server has a few modifications from the original game to make development and bot testing easier:
